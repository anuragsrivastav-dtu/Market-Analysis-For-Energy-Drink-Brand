# Insights 
1) We need to increase our product awareness as 50% of the people in the dataset never heard about our product.Secondly,we should focus on increasing our availability in supermarkets as most of the customers purchase energy drinks from supermarkets. we have seen that  most of the people consume energy drink for increasing the mental focus and stamina so local shops around gym complexes and shops near or in the sport complexes can increase the product sales significantly.
2) In determining the ideal price, our analysis indicates that the majority of our target audience falls within the 15-30 age group. Within this demographic, a substantial number expresses a preference for a price range between 50-99 INR. Therefore, we propose setting the initial price at 99 INR, with the possibility of gradual increases over time
3) Our target customers primarily belong to the 15-30 age group. Individuals aged 15-20 are typically open to trying new products, provided we strategically position our offerings. For those in the 21-30 age range, many prioritize their careers and fitness. This demographic often consumes energy drinks during physical activities or late working hours to combat fatigue. We can emphasize in our advertising that our product contains vitamin C and Coffice to enhance productivity and energy levels
4) n terms of brand ambassadors, we are considering two or more individuals. One option is a social media influencer, particularly a renowned YouTuber with a strong and positive influence on the younger audienceâ€”individuals such as Elvish Yadav or Fukra Inssan are noteworthy candidates. Additionally, we are exploring the possibility of collaborating with a popular Bollywood star known for their excellent physique.
5) For our marketing campaigns, one potential strategy is to organize fan meet-ups in various cities, featuring local renowned YouTube celebrities. This approach allows us to connect with the audience on a more personal level and leverage the popularity of regional influencers.
